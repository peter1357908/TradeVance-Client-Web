# High Priority

Use a more secure authentication scheme (currently the client sends naked authentication inforamtion, which is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack)

# Sanity Check


# Consistency

* Use Class Component for Section1 and Section2 under Landing (because they require event handling)
* Name the object key "profile" rather than "user" in the user-related actions (and on the API side)


# Definitions, Specifications, and Clarifications


# (Micro-)Optimizations


# New Features for Users

## easy

## moderate

* Responsiveness (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51744517)):
  * NavBar
  * Landing

## hard


# New Features for the Client

## easy

* Store and use images server-side (e.g. the logo used for the navbar)

## moderate

## hard
